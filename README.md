This file contains code and the question that I answered as a part of my schools step lite program.

To solve this question used trees, where each move would create a new node, and these would branch until a nodes string either reaches a length of 10, or that position has already been traversed elsewhere

I was able to solve part A but not part B, because there is no solution, and there is no way to know for sure that there is no solution using my method. This program will come to a natural end when all possible nodes have been expanded and no nodes with a string less than 10 have been expanded.
